HIDE n SEEK
===========

### Purpose statement:
this app is designed to promote active fun as a multiplayer, physical hide-and-seek style game for older children and adults.

### Types of users:

- High school students
- Campers
- Party goers
- Adventurers

More generally, this app would appeal to people who are looking for fun things to do outdoors in places like large parks or city markets.

### Key functionality:

First of all, this app requires a coordinating game server on the web. In order to play a game, one device running the app must log into the server as the “host.” Other devices will then join the hosted game.

Once all devices have been connected and the host has set any game preferences (including designating one or more people to be “it”), a timer begins to count down while the users disperse over a large area. Once the timer is depleted, whoever is “it” begins to search for the other as in standard hide-and-seek. The app then gives that person directional hints towards the other users based on the GPS coordinates of their devices. Additionally, that person is given the option to “give up.” When this is chosen, the app notifies all users that the round is over and reveals the GPS position of each.

When a person is found by one who is “it,” the former person presses a button to notify the server. Once all people are found, the app notifies all users and reveals GPS positions.

A group chat system may also be implemented, but this feature might not be part of the prototype or initial release.

Another possible feature could be a “passive mode” in which the positions of all users which log in are shown constantly on the map. This mode would not have any hide-and-seek operations; it would just be for keeping track of a group’s location.
